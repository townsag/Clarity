This document outlines how to run the tests included in our project

this project is written in go so you will need to have go installed
1. go to the official go website: https://go.dev/doc/install
2. once go is installed navigate to the directory where the go _test.go files are
3. in order to run the test you can use the command: 'go test -v -run TESTNAME' to run a specific test with all the terminal prints
4. alternatively you can use the command: 'go test -v -run ../. to run all the tests at once. keep in mind that if you are running in
   an IDE's terminal, logs could be truncated
